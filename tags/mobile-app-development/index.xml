      <description>About two month ago, I started making a React Native app &amp;ldquo;PyConTW 17&amp;rdquo; for the biggest annual Python conference in Taiwan (PyCon Taiwan). The app is quite simple, but still took some efforts for me to build. As a complete React newbie, I would like to share some of my thoughts about React Native.
