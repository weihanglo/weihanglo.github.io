      <description>As a non-native English speaker, I often try several methods to improve my English skills. Listening to podcasts is one of the most interesting way to practice English, especially with fascinating topics I indulge in.
Therefore, I pick some of my favorite podcasts about software engineering to share with you. Enjoy these awesome shows and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to give them some feedback.
